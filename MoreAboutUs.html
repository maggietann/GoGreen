      <br> Being honest, I don't do as much recycling as I should be. Throughout my life, it was always my parents who took care of these things. However, after understanding how much the world is hurting from humans' activies, I think it is time to take action and learn about the different ways of recycling. For example, instead of throwing away old clothes we can donate it. Instead of throwing glass away, we can reuse it or if not, keep them in a seperate place until there is more to bring to recycling machines. Small things can make a huge impact, so lets start small together!

      <br> During the pandemic both my parents loss their jobs. I knew I needed to help them financially and one of the ways I started was by recyling cans, plastic bottles, and glass in exchange for money. I recycled every week outside a nearby grocery store that offered recycling machines. At first my fuel was to help my parents financially, but after 10 months of being in that environement/ community my love for recycling grew because now I didn't just need the money, but I was significantly helping our planet earth and atmosphere.
